Nowadays, many news aggregation platforms need an automated way to classify the large
and growing amount of news. Although the original news resource might already contain
category labels, the labels are not always consistent from various platforms. Therefore, an
automated classification method is needed to enhance efficiency.
With the rapid update of news, the automatic classification system can classify news in real
time to ensure that users get the latest and most relevant content. It also improves the
resilience of news resources.
